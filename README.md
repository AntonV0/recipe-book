# Recipe Book
## Project #60 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
This projects focuses playing the role of two collaborators working on a recipe book with various GitHub commands. 

The origin respository was cloned. Changes were made in the files within the origin repository, which were added to the Git staging area and committed. These changes were then fetched from the remote to the cloned repository. Then, origin/master was merged into the local master branch. A new branch was created to then update the text in new-recipe.txt. This was added to the staging area and committed. Finally, the new branch was pushed to the remote.
## What I Learned
  - Expanded my understanding of many collaborative GitHub commands that were also used in the previous two projects (#58 and #59)
